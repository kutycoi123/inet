Easy to Handle Changes
======================

..   1. change or action
     2. phenomenon / effect
     3. solution
     4. example

Some changes in the model don't change fingerprints at all, and unlikely to cause regressions.

For example, we extract some part of the ``handleUpperCommand()`` function in the :ned:`Udp` module to a new function:

.. literalinclude:: ../Udp.cc.extract
   :diff: ../Udp.cc.orig

.. **Why doesn't it change the fingerprint?**

These changes include renaming C++ classes, functions and variables, and extracting methods or classes, refactoring algorithms.

The refactoring doesn't change the fingerprint because the code is functionally the same; it doesn't create any new events or data packets, and it doesn't change timing, or anything that the fingerprint calculation takes into account:

.. TODO: PASS

.. .. role:: green

.. :green:`PASS`

.. code-block:: fp
