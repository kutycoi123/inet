Accepting Fingerprint Changes
=============================

TODO link here from everywhere else

so

if the model is verified using the previous steps,
then the ingredients can be returned to tplx

because the model was verified after a change
and there was no change since then

- replace ingredients with tplx
- run the tests
- overwrite the csv file

also, when the fingerprint tool cant be used to verify the model, it needs to be
inspected and then it can be decided that its correct
-> not here? thats another step ?
